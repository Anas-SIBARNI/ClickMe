# Welcome to ClickMe

This game is a personnal project carried out by __Anas SIBARNI__, a second-year Bachelor's degree in computer sciences student.

The goal of the game is very (very) simple : **CLICK A BUTTON** !

You can retrieve your progress if you register.

I wanted to learn Angular and Supabase so I did this litle game.
